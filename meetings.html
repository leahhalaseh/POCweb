                        <h2><b>First meeting, October 13th 2015, 14:30</b></h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li> <b>Individuals involved :</b> Gill Glover (Microsoft ), David Goldsby (National Grid), Leah Halaseh (UCL), Iacovos Pantekhis (UCL) , Bagus Maulana (UCL) </li>
                            <li> Went through the general idea of the project relating to National Grid and the minimum requirements for the national grid workers. 
                            Next meeting to be held face to face to discuss the real objectives of the project, the target platforms and the deadlines . 
                            Not much covered in first call, actual requirements will be covered in the face to face meeting. 
                            Expected of team members to research about Microsoft band and what can be done for the national workers healthcare. </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2><b>Second meeting, October 20th 2015, 11:00</b></h2> 
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Individuals involved :</b> Gill Glover (Microsoft), David Goldsby (National Grid), Laura Mohomed (National Grid), Leah Halaseh (UCL), Iacovos Pantekhis (UCL), Bagus Maulana (UCL) </li>

                            
                            <li> We discussed the objectives and ideas of the project and what we are able to do. We also talked about the platform and what they would prefer it on. They have informed us that they would like the app of the Microsoft band to be on the iPhone 5c. 
                            We have also established a communication platform on OneNote where we all share ideas that have come up, as well as our progress. 
                            We refined the requirements by establishing the minimum needs from the project. We have also established that the rest of the requirements can’t be finalised until we get our hands and experiment with the Microsoft band. 
                            We also agreed that for the time being, we should learn about developing on Xcode for iOS as well as developing for the Microsoft band. </li>
                        </ul>

                            <h2><b>Third meeting, October 27th 2015, 13:30</b></h2>

                                <li> We had a video call with another member of National Grid, Heather Quiney(technical developer), to formally introduce ourselves. She will be tracking our progress so she will be able to take over the project once we are finished. </li>
                        </ul>

                         <h2><b>Fourth meeting, January 21st 2016, 13:30</b></h2>
                        <ul>
                                <li><b>Individuals involved :</b> Gill Glover (Microsoft),Leah Halaseh (UCL), Iacovos Pantekhis (UCL), Bagus Maulana (UCL) </li>

                                <li> 
                                On the 21st of January, 2016, we had a phone call meeting with Gill Glover, Microsoft, to catch up on our progress. We discussed what we will be accomplishing and by when we will accomplish it and we both agreed and specified the minimum features our app should have. She also informed us of the new potential clients we will be working with, National Rail, and also set up a meeting with them.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2><b>Fifth meeting, January 27th 2016, 13:30</b></h2>
                        <ul>
                                <li><b>Individuals involved :</b> Network Rail, Gill Glover (Microsoft),Leah Halaseh (UCL), Iacovos Pantekhis (UCL), Bagus Maulana (UCL) </li>

                                <li> 
                                On the 27th of January, 2016 at 1 PM we had a phone call meeting with Gill Glover, Microsoft, and our new clients network rail. We informed them what we have accomplished so far and discussed their minimum requirements. We negotiated how their minimum requirements can be integrated with our project so far.
                                The needs they had did not differ much from the previous clients, National Grid. In terms of potential updates to requirements we discussed the following areas:<ul>
                                <li>1. A Check in facility every 30 minutes</li>
                                <li>2. Ability to have the data randomised so perhaps only role/location i known,it should certainly not be possible to identify the individual whereabouts all of the time.</li>
                                <li>3. When the panic button is pressed extra data should be sent with the alert so this may be shared with the emergency services.</li></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2><b>Sixth meeting, February 16th 2016, 13:30</b></h2>
                        <ul>
                                <li><b>Individuals involved :</b> Network Rail, Gill Glover (Microsoft),Leah Halaseh (UCL), Iacovos Pantekhis (UCL), Bagus Maulana (UCL) </li>

                                <li> 
                                During the meeting, Gill introduced the Network Rail representatives with our progress with them and our previous client so far. We informed them about what we have researched further since our last meeting (e.g. our work with the Windows Phone). Network Rail showed us their existing solution to us and expressed their requirements for what our solution would need to add. We explained our plans to develop our app further, and also discussed and negotiated with Network Rail about the direction of our project and the app we are building, taking into consideration our research, plans, and constraints, and Network Rail’s requirements.
                                In terms of the additional requirements that our solution would need to have, Network Rail has expressed their interest on the following:
                                <ul>
                                <li>1. Ability for workers to ‘check in’ every 30 minutes during work.</li>
                                <li>2. Ability for the worker to “switch off” the data tracking while not working.</li>
                                <li>3. When the panic button is pressed, extra data should be sent with the notification to HQ to be shared with emergency services.</li>
                                <li>4. Modular components to make it easier to combine our app with their
                                existing solution.</li>
                                <li>5. Cross platform capability if possible</li> </ul>
                        </ul>
