                    		<h2>Microsoft Band Information</h2>
                    	</div>

                    	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-7">
                    		<h3>General Info</h3>
                    		<p>The Microsoft Band is a wearable device in the form of a smart band with (some) smartwatch features that focuses on health and fitness tracking. The Band by default can track your steps, heart rate, distance travelled, calories burned, etc. via various sensors.</p>
                    		<p>The Band can be paired with an iOS, Android, or Windows smartphone. It connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth. To pair a phone with the Band, the Microsoft Health app needs to be downloaded on the phone. A single phone can only be paired with a single Microsoft Band (and vice versa) at a time. Once paired, the Band can display notifications from the phone such as e-mails and messages, and apps on the phone (including the Microsoft Health app) can alter how the Band works, such as by adding and removing tiles.</p>
                    		<p>There are currently two versions of the Band: The original Microsoft Band, released in Oct 2014, and the Microsoft Band 2 which was released on Nov 2015. The Band 2 incorporates five new sensors, slightly wider resolution (320x128 vs 320x106), and a curved-screen display, but otherwise has the same functionalty and features as the original Band. Apps made for Band 1 can be used for Band 2 and vice versa, though apps using a sensor exclusively for Band 2 are not backwards-compatible.</p>

                    		<h3>Tile UI</h3>
                    		<p>The Microsoft Band UI is made up of "tiles" which can be opened. By default, there are 11 tiles on the Band, and tiles can be added/removed via the Microsoft Health app or by another app on the phone. The Band can have a maximum of 13 tiles at a time. Each tile consists of up to 8 pages of content.</p>

                    		<p>There are two different types of tiles, as defined by the Band SDK Documentation:</p>
                    		<ul class="list-fix-align">
	                            <li>Messaging tiles: Displays messages received from an app in the phone. We can use this to send alerts from the Head Office to the Band.</li>
	                            <li>Custom tiles: Can send information to the phone when a button in a page is tapped. We can use this for our panic button.</li>
	                        </ul>

                    		<p>Each tile has their own:</p>
                    		<ul class="list-fix-align">
	                            <li>Icon (46x46px on Band, 48x48px on Band 2)</li>
	                            <li>Small icon (24x24px)</li>
	                            <li>Title/name</li>
	                            <li>UUID</li>
	                        </ul>   

                    		<h3>Microsoft Band SDK</h3>
                    		<p><a href="http://developer.microsoftband.com/bandSDK">Link to official page</a></p>
                    		<p>The Microsoft Band SDK is the development platform necessary to build apps for the Microsoft Band. It is available for iOS, Android, and Windows mobile OSes. The app using the SDK must be built for and installed on the paired smartphone. The SDK then allows the app to customise the Band, including to create new tiles defined by the app and send messages/notifications, and receive sensor data from the Band. The <a href="http://developer.microsoftband.com/Content/docs/Microsoft%20Band%20SDK.pdf">official documentation</a> for the SDK shows how to implement these functions in native code for iOS, Android, and Windows.</p>

                    <div class="row padtop-slight">
                    	<h2>App Platforms and Tools</h2>
                    	<p>The Microsoft Band supports Windows, Android, and iOS mobile platforms.</p>
                    	<p>The Band SDK allows apps to be built for either of these platforms to communicate with the Band. The SDK is built using native code (C# for Windows, Java for Android, and Objective-C for iOS, respectively) and the mobile app has to be built in native code if we are to make use of the SDK as shown in the official documentation. Microsoft has also provided sample apps for the Band in Windows, Android, and iOS as a starting point. We have also discovered third-party Band SDKs for cross-platform development platforms <a href="https://components.xamarin.com/gettingstarted/microsoft-band-sdk">Xamarin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dkundel/band-cordova">Cordova</a>, and <a href="http://purplecabbage.github.io/slides/PGMeetupApr2015/index.html#/7">PhoneGap</a>, however we have yet to be able to get these third-party SDKs to work.</p>
                    	<p>Our app needs to be built for mobile devices (as opposed to tablets or PCs) as we need the app on a device that the Lone Worker will be able to carry with them (along with the Band) all the time while working.</p>

                    	<h3>iOS (Objective-C)</h3>
                    	<p>Microsoft Band SDK supports iOS as an official platform. The Band SDK for iOS and its features is implemented natively on Objective-C. iOS 7 or later is required for the Band SDK.</p>

                    	<p>Native iOS development requires the use of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a>, only available on Mac OS machines. This is a major problem as we do not have the adequate resources to develop on iOS as a group, as we only have access to one Mac OS PC and one iOS mobile device for testing. If we are to develop the app for iOS, we will only be able to work one at a time. A Mac OS PC is still required to build iOS apps even if we choose to develop the app on a non-native platform using Xamarin or Cordova/PhoneGap (see below). iOS was originally our client's first choice of platform as a majority of their Lone Workers use iOS mobile devices, however it is infeasible for us to build the app on iOS due to our resource constrains.</p>

                    	<h3>Android (Java)</h3>
                    	<p>Microsoft Band SDK supports Android as an official platform. The Band SDK for Android and its features is implemented natively on Android's version of Java. Android 4.2 (API 17) and later is required for the Band SDK.</p>

                    	<p>Native Android apps are developed on <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">Android SDK</a>, a slightly modified version of Java with Anrdoid features and Google APIs included, and typically developed using <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">Android Studio</a>. We have managed to build, run, and modify the sample Band SDK apps for Android, including functionalities such as receiving heart rate sensor readings, creating tiles on the Band, sending messages, and creating a tile on the Band with a button that the phone can detect when the button on the Band is pressed. Android is the most widely used mobile OS among the general public, however we do not know for sure how popular Android devices are amongst Lone Workers, and will need to consult with our client further.</p>

                    	<h3>Windows (C#)</h3>
                    	<p>Microsoft Band SDK supports Windows as an official platform. The Band SDK for Windows devices is implemented natively on C#. Since Windows 10, Windows Store apps for Windows mobile devices (previously Windows Phone), tablets, and PCs have been merged into one Universal Windows Platform (UWP). Windows 8.1 / Windows Phone 8.1 or later is required for the Band SDK</p>

                    	<p>Our app, should we decide to develop for Windows, will still be targeted for mobile devices (UI and functionality wise). Windows apps are typically built using Visual Studio, which is available for free for students, and contains a Windows mobile simulator. Also, we will be able to borrow a Windows mobile device from UCL. However, Windows mobile devices are not as widely used as iOS or Android devices, and we assume not many Lone Workers will be able to benefit from a Windows mobile app.</p>

                    	<h3>Xamarin (C#)</h3>
                    	<p><a href="https://xamarin.com/">Xamarin</a> is a cross-platform mobile development tool used to make apps that works simultaneously on iOS and Android with C#. Xamarin apps are structured with an iOS/Android layer that contains the UI and app layers (but still written on C#) and a Core Library layer that contains shared code such as business and data layers. Xamarin allows developers to add components to their apps, and they have a <a href="https://components.xamarin.com/gettingstarted/microsoft-band-sdk">Microsoft Band SDK</a> component that which we can potentially use, though we have not tested this yet. While their main products require a <a href="https://store.xamarin.com/">montly or annual payment</a>, they also have a <a href="https://xamarin.com/starter">Starter edition</a> that we can use for free, and should be enough to build our PoC. Xamarin apps can be built with an add-on to Visual Studio or their own Xamarin Studio. However, their Android and iOS development tools require access to Android SDK for Android and Xcode for iOS, and it is impossible to work on the iOS components on non-Mac PCs (<a href="http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/getting_started/installation/windows/">Their tutorial</a> claims that it is possible to work on the iOS components on a Windows PC connected to a Mac OS X PC through SSH, though we have not tried it yet). Also, our first try at using the Xamarin Studio (Starter edition) to run their sample app on Android was not successful.</p>

                    	<h3>Cordova/PhoneGap (HTML/CSS/JS)</h3>
                    	<p><a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a> is a tool that allows developers to build mobile apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, targetting multiple platforms with one code base. <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a> is a distribution of Cordova that adds additional tools. There is no official SDK for Microsoft Band built on Cordova or PhoneGap, but we have found two third-party repositories that claims to have implemented the Microsoft Band SDK for Cordova/PhoneGap, one using <a href="https://github.com/dkundel/band-cordova">Cordova</a> and one using <a href="https://github.com/purplecabbage/phonegap-plugin-msband">PhoneGap</a>. However, our attempts at getting either third-party SDK to build were unsuccessful.</p>

                    	<h3>Platform Choice</h3>
                    	<p>At the moment, our platform of choice for the development of the prototype is Android. While our client's first choice is iOS, we did not have the resources to develop as a team for iOS. Android is more widely used than Windows mobile so between these two we went with Android. We tried also to use cross-platform tools such as Xamarin and Cordova/PhoneGap using third-party Band SDKs but none of the SDKs for these platforms worked in our testing. With these considerations, we chose to work with native Android for the prorotype for now.</p>

                    <div class="row padtop-slight">

                    	<h2>Web Components (Dashboard)</h2>
                    	<p>We also need to develop a web dashboard for the Head Office to be able to send and receive alerts and receive 'panic button' alarms from Lone Workers. It should also contain an online authentication systemthat ccan be accessed by Lone Workers via the mobile app. Based on our requirements, our web dashboard needs to do:</p>
                    	<ul class="center list-fix-align">
                    		<li>Online authentication system (Mobile app can request authentication for Lone Workers, separates between admin login and Lone Worker login)</li>
                    		<li>Send (text) alerts from admin/Head Office to all Lone Workers</li>
                    		<li>Receive (text) responses to these alerts from Lone Workers and display them on the Dashboard</li>
                    		<li>Receive 'panic button' alarms (consisting of heart rate, body temperature, distance walked, and GPS information) from Lone Workers and display them on the Dashboard</li>
                    		<li>Monitor lone worker's stress levels based on their heart rate</li>
                    	</ul>

                    	<h3>Web Tiles</h3>
                    	<p><a href="http://developer.microsoftband.com/WebTile">Link to official page</a></p>
                    	<p>Microsoft Band web tile allows developers to deliver information to Microsoft Band from virtually any data source on the web. Web Tiles once set up will periodically fetch web resources (using JSON or XML formats) and delivering them to the web tile on the Band. Web tiles are controlled by the Microsoft Health app on the mobile device. Web tiles supports RSS and ATOM feeds. More information and details on how to implement it can be found on the <a href="https://developer.microsoftband.com/Content/docs/Microsoft%20Band%20Web%20Tile%20Documentation.pdf">documentation</a>.</p>
                    	<p>We will look into using Web Tiles to send alerts from the Head Office to lone workers, by integrating it to the dashboard. The Head Office shall be able to send messages to the web tiles of every lone worker through the dashboard. We will also look into allowing the Head Office to only send alerts to specific workers. We will also look for other alternatives to deliver these alerts.</p>

                    	<h3>Microsoft Health Cloud API</h3>
                    	<p><a href="https://developer.microsoftband.com/cloudAPI">Link to official page</a></p>
                    	<p>The Microsoft Health Cloud API allows client apps and services to make use of real-time user data from the Microsoft Band. It provides said data using RESTful APIs in a JSON format. The client apps can be web, windows (desktop) or windows (mobile) based. The API can be implemented in C# (Windows) or Javascript (Web).</p>
                    	<p>We will look into the possibility of using this API to integrate real-time data of each worker's heart rate (for stress levels) on the dashboard.</p>

                    	<h3>Google Identity Platform</h3>
                    	<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/">Link to official page</a></p>
	                    <p>Google Identity Platform is a set of identity tools from Google to quickly build an auth system. It contains the following tools that we can possibly use:</p>
	                    <ul class="center list-fix-align">
                    		<li>Google Sign-In, enabling users to sign in to the app using their Google account. (Android/iOS/Web)</li>
                    		<li>Smart Lock for Passwords, a password tool that allows users to be automatically signed in across all of their Chrome and Android devices after their first sign-up/sign-in. (Android only)</li>
                    		<li>Identity Toolkit, a toolkit that provides password authentication and federated sign-in with major identity providers such as Google, Facebook, and more. (Android/iOS/Web)</li>
                    		<li>OpenID Connect, An OAuth 2.0-based protocol to build our own sign-in solutions.</li>
                    	</ul>
	                    <p>We will look into using one or more Google Identity Platform tool to build an online auth system for our app. We will also look for other possible alternatives.</p>
